# 2d6 Dungeon App

[![.NET](https://github.com/FBoucher/2d6-dungeon-app/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FBoucher/2d6-dungeon-app/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

[2D6 Dungeon](https://drgames.co.uk/2d6-dungeon-a-classic-dungeon-crawler-solo-player-game/) is a classic style dungeon crawler, print and play, roll and write game designed for solo play. You explore randomly generated dungeon rooms, fight monsters and collect treasure as you gain experience and strive to become a legendary adventurer. Every adventure and dungeon is unique. I was created by DR Games and it's a paper and dice game.

This project is a digital version of the game, with creator's approval. It's a web application that allows you to play the game on your computer or mobile device. It's a work in progress. I progress by iteration improuving the code, the struture at each passes.

### How to Run it Locally

The solution uses .NET Aspire to manage all the services and website. 

- You will need Docker [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/), and [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed.
- Clone the repository locally.
- To start 2d6-dungeon-client, from Open the solution in VSCode or Visual Studio and press F5. If asked for the starting point of the solution select the orchestrator `AppHost`. Once the solution starts it will:
  - Open the .NET Aspire Dashboard in a web browser.
  - Create a MySQL container, create the database using the SQL script included.
  - Create a data API, in a second container.
  - Start the 2D6 Dungeon webApp.

Once everything is âœ… Running, click on the Endpoint of the webApp
